/**
 * Base type for domain entities within Binocular that expose two notions of identity:
 *
 * 1. **`iid` (internal/technical id):** A stable, immutable identifier for this
 *    instance (e.g., aggregate-local id or value uniquely derived
 *    at creation time). Used here to derive `hashCode()`.
 * 2. **`uniqueKey` (business key):** A domain/natural key that should be unique
 *    within the relevant boundary (e.g., within a repository or project).
 *    Used by collection helpers (e.g., `NonRemovingMutableSet`) to enforce
 *    de-duplication based on business semantics.
 *
 * ### Equality & hashing
 * - `equals` returns `true` **only if**:
 *   1. same reference, or
 *   2. exact same runtime class **and** both `iid` **and** `uniqueKey` are equal.
 * - `hashCode` is derived **only** from `iid`.
 *
 * This satisfies the contract: if two objects are equal, they have the same `iid`
 * and therefore the same `hashCode`. Non-equal objects may share the same hash
 * (e.g., equal `iid` but different `uniqueKey`), which is allowed and at worst
 * increases collisions.
 *
 * ### Contracts & invariants
 * - `iid` MUST be effectively immutable for the lifetime of the object; do not
 *   mutate it after construction (would corrupt hash-based collections).
 * - `uniqueKey` MUST be stable and **domain-unique** within its scope; if it is
 *   composite, model it as a value type with proper `equals/hashCode`.
 * - If a subclass overrides `equals`, it MUST ensure that equal objects produce
 *   the same `hashCode`. In practice, that means either:
 *   - base `equals` on the same `iid`, or
 *   - also override `hashCode` consistently (not recommended to diverge here).
 *
 * ### Usage guidance
 * - Prefer **reference equality** for entity identity checks at runtime unless
 *   your domain explicitly requires value equality.
 * - For de-duplicating by business semantics (e.g., commits by `sha`,
 *   branches by `repo+name`), use `uniqueKey` and key-aware collections like
 *   `NonRemovingMutableSet`.
 * - Sub-classed `data class`es **must** override `equals/hashCode` to avoid kotlin's auto-generated
 *   `equals/hashCode`. Simply use:
 *   ```kotlin
 *   override fun equals(other: Any?) = super.equals(other)
 *   override fun hashCode(): Int = super.hashCode()
 *   ```
 *
 * ### Example
 * ```kotlin
 * // required for kotlin UUID:
 * // https://kotlinlang.org/api/core/kotlin-stdlib/kotlin.uuid/-experimental-uuid-api/
 * @OptIn(ExperimentalUuidApi::class)
 * Commit(
 *   [...]
 * ) : AbstractDomainObject<Commit.Id, String>(
 *      Commit.Id(Uuid.random())
 * ) {
 *     @JvmInline
 *     value class Id(val value: Uuid)
 *     [...]
 * }
 * ```

     * Business/natural key that uniquely identifies this object **in domain terms**.

     * - Should be stable and immutable for reliable collection semantics.
     * - Often a value type (e.g., data class or tuple) capturing the natural key.
