Summary of missing / non-working features in the new GraphQL endpoint

1. Missing common query arguments
   - Pagination & filtering arguments are not supported on many root fields:
     - since, until (Timestamp filters)
     - sort (ASC / DESC)
     - page, perPage
   - A shared Sort input type is completely missing from the schema.

2. Incompatible query signatures
   - Several root queries changed their required arguments:
     - branch now requires an id instead of supporting branchName
     - file requires id instead of supporting path
   - Existing client queries relying on name/path based lookup no longer work.

3. Missing connection-style response structures
   - data fields expected by the tests are missing:
     - commits.data
     - files.data
     - branch.files.data
   - This breaks list-style access patterns used throughout the old API.

4. Missing fields on core domain types
   - The following fields are not exposed anymore:
     - MergeRequest: sourceBranch, targetBranch, author, assignee, assignees
     - Issue: author, assignee, assignees
     - Note: author
   - These fields are required for ownership, issue, and MR visualizations.

5. Sorting not implemented on list queries
   - sort is rejected on:
     - builds
     - commits
     - branches
   - Ordering guarantees used by existing visualizations are lost.

6. Backward-incompatible schema changes
   - The new schema is not a drop-in replacement:
     - Filters, sorting, pagination, and nested structures differ
     - Existing clients and tests cannot run without query rewrites
