        This plugin is designed to visualize the number of commits that include test classes within a specified time range. It provides a
        clear and interactive timeline that highlights testing activity in the project repository, helping track test coverage trends over
        time. The visualization can be used to monitor testing efforts, identify gaps, and support data-driven decisions during development
        cycles.
